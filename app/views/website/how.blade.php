        <h2>We want to make sure you do not move to your next property without knowing it's history.</h2>
        
        <p>The idea of this website is to improve Australia Real Estate quality.</p>
        <p>How are going to do this? <br/> Simple! </p>
        <p>Every time you move out, you list the reason you did it. So the next tenant will know what happened there.</p>
        <p> This would include information about: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The area</li>
            <li>The neighbor</li>
            <li>The Real Estate</li>
            <li>The property</li>
            <li>Reason of moving out</li>
            <li>What sort of people live around(students, workers and on)</li>
            <li>How much was and how much is the rent</li>
            <li>So on.</li>
        </ul>
